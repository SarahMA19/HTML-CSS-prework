                <small>All Things Sourdough.</small>
                <p class="main-paragraph">Like many people during the pandemic, I got into sourdough baking. I found a wonderful blog and fell in love with making food from scratch. There is something a bit mysterious about sourdough starter. You take water and flour and grow it into this amazing bubbly texture. Each starter is unique to the bacteria
                    in the home. I was nervous that I would not be able to keep my starter alive, but I have found it to be super forgiving. I have had mine for three years now and I hope it to be something I can pass along to my daughter one day. There is just something theraputic about working with your hands, kneeding dough, shaping into these beautiful
                    nutrient foods. Some favorites in our home are fresh milk & honey bread, cinnamon rolls & dutch babies.</p>

                <small>"Movement is the song of the body." - Vanda Scaravelli</small>
                <p class="main-paragraph">I have always enjoyed working out. Did a few low-key sports growing up, my favorite being crew! As an adult I have trained for two marathons and tried the body building gym rat lifestyle. I transitioned to working out from home in my garage after having my daughter
                    with very minimal equiment. Joined a wonderful membership called Street Parking that is similart to Crossfit, but scalable for all fitness levels. Now I am enjoying daily walks. My life has encounterd many changes along with dealing with an injury, so I am taking the hint and slowing down. Daily walks have been 
                    a wonderful way for me to get movemement in this season of life.</p>

                <small>Investing in yourself</small>
                <p class="main-paragraph">I have grown to love Therapy and/or counseling. It is like a rabbit hole, there is so much to work through in life even if you think everything is "fine". I started going regulaly last year and I never regret a session. I have recently found a podcast that just speaks to me, it is in the link above 
                    under "Therapy". It has been such a blessing to listen as I do my daily walks and come to such understanding within myself. Such a gift.</p>

                    <small>Have I lost my mind?!</small>
                    <p>It is still hard to belive that I have signed up for a coding bootcamp. Life is crazy. I come from a background of sports marketing & dental, nothing even close to the world of tech. A major life change caused the need to revaluate my life. I wanted a job that would provide well for myself
                        and my daughter finacially. A job that would provide flexiabilty of hours/working from home. Also, I think there is a part of me that wanted a bit of a challenge, push myself out of my comfort zone and do the hard things. This will be a steep learning curve I am sure, but I am so ready to learn and build a 
                        life that I've always wanted. Do I know what that looks like yet? No, but I am excited to find out.</p>
